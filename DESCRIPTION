Description: R package to set up gridded XN5 simulations. The core idea is to setup a z, x, y, tile grid (in XN5: grid, i, j, tile), where:
    \emph{z} is the vertical component, used as the grid layers (e.g. stochastic weather),
    \emph{x} is the spatial grid abscissa, e.g. spatial explicit properties,
    \emph{y} is the spatial grid ordinate, e.g. for stochastic soil properties, and
    \emph{tile} are the grid cell's sub-columns, e.g. crop rotations.
